On December 5, 2023, [the Federal Railroad Administration announced](https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-first-step-expanding-amtrak-ohio) funding to support new Amtrak service in Ohio on three corridors:

The announcement also included an increase in trains on the Chicago-Cleveland-DC-NYC Cardinal line, to daily service.

## New Stop Locations

Click around the map for more details on these station locations, and on the route of the trains. This list isn't official; there's still years of planning and construction work yet to come. But it's my best guess, based on [existing track locations](https://ohiodot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=82f597df8411453cafb18d62c371bc47) and public statements by planners.

New stations on the the 3C+D line are based on [an Amtrak handout about the 3C+D line](https://media.amtrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3CD-Corridor-Fact-Sheet-05-17-Final.pdf)[^1]:

- Sharonville
- Dayton
- Springfield
- Greater Columbus Convention Center
- Delaware
- Crestline
- Cleveland Hopkins International Airport

New stations for the Chicago-Pittsburgh route are based on the stops mentioned in [Senator Brown's announcement of Chicago-Fort Wayne-Columbus-Pittsburgh](https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-first-step-expanding-amtrak-ohio).[^3]

- Hobart, Indiana &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_station_(Indiana)) that could be reopened.
- Gary, Indiana &mdash; is already served by Amtrak, but with the way the tracks are laid out, Gary will require either a new station for service on the Chicago-Pittsburgh line, or it will require laying new tracks to connect the existing station to the rail line that services Hobart and points east.
- Valparaiso, Indiana
- Plymouth, Indiana
- Warsaw, Indiana &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_station_(Indiana)) that could be refurbished and reopened.
- Fort Wayne, Indiana &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Wayne_station) that could be reopened.
- Lima, Ohio &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_station_(Pennsylvania_Railroad)) that could be reopened.
- Kenton, Ohio
- Marysville, Ohio
- Greater Columbus Convention Center, Ohio &mdash; [The designs for this station are already made](https://columbusunderground.com/study-amtrak-station-new-plaza-could-be-added-to-convention-center-bw1/), and recent construction at the Convention Center has reserved space for this station.
- John Glenn Columbus International Airport, Ohio &mdash; I guess this is the most logical location for a multi-modal transportation center in Columbus. Certainly not [some gas station in Hilltop](https://news.wosu.org/2023-06-30/customers-unhappy-with-changes-at-new-west-columbus-greyhound-bus-terminal).
- Newark, Ohio
- Coshocton, Ohio
- Newcomerstown, Ohio
- Uhrichsville, Ohio &mdash; has [a historic station](https://dennisondepot.org/) in active use as a museum, which could be reopened.
- Steubenville, Ohio

New station locations for the Cleveland-Toledo-Detroit line are based on those mentioned in [Amtrak's Cleveland-Detroit-Pontiac planning document](https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/cleveland-detroit-pontiac/)[^2]:

- Cleveland Hopkins International Airport
- Detroit Airport

These stops differ slightly from the [Amtrak Connects US webpage's list](https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/cleveland-columbus-cincinnati/), dropping Hamilton and adding Sharonville.
