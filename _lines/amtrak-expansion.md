### New Stop Locations

This list of stops includes stops for the 3C+D line in [an Amtrak handout about the 3C+D line](https://media.amtrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3CD-Corridor-Fact-Sheet-05-17-Final.pdf)[^1], mentioned in [Amtrak's Cleveland-Detroit-Pontiac planning document](https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/cleveland-detroit-pontiac/)[^2], and stops mentioned in [Senator Brown's announcement of Chicago-Fort Wayne-Columbus-Pittsburgh](https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-first-step-expanding-amtrak-ohio).[^3]

These stops differ slightly from the [Amtrak Connects US webpage's list](https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/cleveland-columbus-cincinnati/), dropping Hamilton and adding Sharonville.
[^2]: This line is called by various names; I've seen "Cleveland-Toledo-Detroit" in Ohio planning documents and "Cleveland-Detroit-Pontiac" in documents that I guess are directed to the Michigan audience. Michigan has much more rail service than Ohio.
[^3]: The list of Chicago-Pittsburgh stops from [Senator Brown's press release](https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-first-step-expanding-amtrak-ohio) matches the list from [the Northern Indiana Passenger Rail Association map for Chicago-Fort Wayne-Columbus](https://niprarail.org/what/).
