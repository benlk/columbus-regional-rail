On December 5, 2023, [the Federal Railroad Administration announced](https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-first-step-expanding-amtrak-ohio) funding to support new Amtrak service in Ohio on three corridors:

The announcement also included an increase in trains on the Chicago-Cleveland-DC-NYC Cardinal line, to daily service.

## New Stop Locations

Click around the map for more details on these station locations, and on the route of the trains. This list isn't official; there's still years of planning and construction work yet to come. But it's my best guess, based on [existing track locations](https://ohiodot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=82f597df8411453cafb18d62c371bc47) and public statements by planners.

New stations on the the 3C+D line are based on [an Amtrak handout about the 3C+D line](https://media.amtrak.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/3CD-Corridor-Fact-Sheet-05-17-Final.pdf)[^1]:

- Sharonville
- Dayton
- Springfield
- Greater Columbus Convention Center
- Delaware &mdash; on US 36, [not at the historic location in Downtown Delaware](https://www.10tv.com/amp/article/news/local/ohio-officials-support-amtrak-expansion/530-9065e317-8079-4546-b3fd-29e8f356ddb6)
- Crestline
- Cleveland Hopkins International Airport &mdash; not actually at the airport, but [at the Puritas light-rail station](https://www.axios.com/local/cleveland/2023/11/13/greyhound-station-bus-stop-puritas-rapid-downtown), a couple miles north-northeast of the airport.

New stations for the Chicago-Pittsburgh route are based on the stops mentioned in [Senator Brown's announcement of Chicago-Fort Wayne-Columbus-Pittsburgh](https://www.brown.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/sherrod-brown-announces-first-step-expanding-amtrak-ohio).[^3]

- Hobart, Indiana &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_station_(Indiana)) that could be reopened.
- Gary, Indiana &mdash; is already served by Amtrak, but with the way the tracks are laid out, Gary will require either a new station for service on the Chicago-Pittsburgh line, or it will require laying new tracks to connect the existing station to the rail line that services Hobart and points east.
- Valparaiso, Indiana
- Plymouth, Indiana
- Warsaw, Indiana &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_station_(Indiana)) that could be refurbished and reopened.
- Fort Wayne, Indiana &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Wayne_station) that could be reopened.
- Lima, Ohio &mdash; has [a historic station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lima_station_(Pennsylvania_Railroad)) that could be reopened.
- Kenton, Ohio
- Marysville, Ohio
- Greater Columbus Convention Center, Ohio &mdash; [The designs for this station are already made](https://columbusunderground.com/study-amtrak-station-new-plaza-could-be-added-to-convention-center-bw1/), and recent construction at the Convention Center has reserved space for this station.
- John Glenn Columbus International Airport, Ohio &mdash; I guess this is the most logical location for a multi-modal transportation center in Columbus. Certainly not [some gas station in Hilltop](https://news.wosu.org/2023-06-30/customers-unhappy-with-changes-at-new-west-columbus-greyhound-bus-terminal).
- Newark, Ohio
- Coshocton, Ohio
- Newcomerstown, Ohio
- Uhrichsville, Ohio &mdash; has [a historic station](https://dennisondepot.org/) in active use as a museum, which could be reopened.
- Steubenville, Ohio

New station locations for the Cleveland-Toledo-Detroit line are based on those mentioned in [Amtrak's Cleveland-Detroit-Pontiac planning document](https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/cleveland-detroit-pontiac/)[^2]:

- Cleveland Hopkins International Airport
- Detroit Airport

## Next steps

[According to the Ohio chapter of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen](https://twitter.com/bletohio/status/1732157444615229591), these are the steps: 

1. Scoping: The sponsors will review the Statement of Work framework from their application and develop scope, schedle, and budget for the Corridor Service Development Plan (SDP). This accounts for any work already started at the time of the announcement. This work can begin immediately, and determines the cost of the second step.
2. Ironing out the details: The sponsors will develop their SDP for the corridor. This will include choices about route, capital expenditures like stations and support facilities, and phases of implementation. This is done in cooperation with the FRA and will determine the cost of the third step.
3. Final design: Step three is the final stage of the process and includes an engineering and environmental design plan. At the end of step three, the sponsor will be able to establish a concrete design schedule and know their construction costs. Once completed and approved, the next step is construction!

And construction may take years. When will we get trains? [BLET Ohio chairman Joh Esterly said](https://twitter.com/realJohnEsterly/status/1732162450131230968): "It all depends on the funding for Steps 2 and 3. Optimistically, we'll have humans on trains by the end of the decade." Worst case? "Maybe 2035?"

These stops differ slightly from the [Amtrak Connects US webpage's list](https://www.amtrakconnectsus.com/maps/cleveland-columbus-cincinnati/), dropping Hamilton and adding Sharonville.
