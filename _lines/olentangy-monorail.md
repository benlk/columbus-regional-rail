This route uses the [SAFEGE suspended monorail technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFEGE#SAFEGE_type_monorail). Unlike the open rails of the [Wuppertal Schewebebahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Schwebebahn), the French SAFEGE technology is well suited to use in cold and wet environments. Some of the best-known monorails using the SAFEGE technology are in Japan, but new lines have recently been built in China.
