Yes, yes, this map is for a [SAFEGE suspended monorail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFEGE#SAFEGE_type_monorail).[^1] But why did I choose a suspended monorail for a line running along the rivers, from Powell to Scioto Downs?

## The argument for a suspended monorail

Unlike the open rails of the [Wuppertal Schewebebahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Schwebebahn), the French SAFEGE technology is well suited to use in cold and wet environments. Some of the best-known monorails using the SAFEGE technology are in Japan, in [Shonan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHdmYZf7QYc) and [Chiba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3_fKjy9Vac), but a new line was recently built in [Wuhan, China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIh8xWxyAQ4). For a people-mover take on the idea, see [the H-Bahns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-Bahn) of Dortmund and D&uml;sseldorf.

Quality transit service demands frequent trains and an unobstructed right-of-way. The elevated track means that several common obstacles: road crossings, sidewalks, trails, rivers. I've chosen to route this train in ways that pierce these common geographic roadblocks, to better connect communities. Elevated stations necessarily require pedestrian access bridges, providing further options to connect communities across highways and rivers. While the trains run overhead, the space underneath is kept open for leisure and wildlife, which is an important concern in the park areas around Columbus' rivers.

Compared to vehicles that ride atop the tracks, there's a much-reduced risk of conflict between passengers and trains. The suspended train never comes into conflict with ground-dwelling pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, or track-walkers. The elevation provides inherent grade separation. In combination with [platform screen doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_screen_doors), there's no opportunity for riders to come in conflict with the vehicle at stations. This setup compares favorably  to the Cinci streetcar, which is often blocked by cars, and to freight trains in Columbus, which are often forced to slow or stop for obstacles on the track.

The SAFEGE monorail design is also well-suited to Columbus' variable weather. The power supply lines are inside the beam, protected from wind and debris. Ice and snow can't accumulate inside the beam. Leaves and branches that fall atop the beam do not interfere with the train's passage, and neither does wildlife: the top of the beam can serve as a nesting area for birds.

## The route

These lands are mostly already owned by state and local governments, so the cost of acquisition is lessened greatly. There's lots of unused airspace along the corridor, and few obstacles to construction. In built-up areas, the monorail runs above major streets, as in Japan.

To help divert suburban commuter traffic from the roads, this line can be accompanied by the construction of several new park-and-ride locations:

The line also takes advantage of the existing park-and-ride at Bethel Road.
