Yes, yes, this map is for a [SAFEGE suspended monorail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFEGE#SAFEGE_type_monorail).[^1] But why did I choose a suspended monorail for a line running along the rivers, from Powell to Scioto Downs?

Unlike the open rails of the [Wuppertal Schewebebahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Schwebebahn), the French SAFEGE technology is well suited to use in cold and wet environments. Some of the best-known monorails using the SAFEGE technology are in Japan, in [Shonan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHdmYZf7QYc) and [Chiba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3_fKjy9Vac), but a new line was recently built in [Wuhan, China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIh8xWxyAQ4). For a people-mover take on the idea, see [the H-Bahns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-Bahn) of Dortmund and D&uml;sseldorf.

The elevated track means that several common obstacles to transit are avoided: roads, sidewalks, trails, rivers. I've chosen to route this train in ways that pierce these common geographic roadblocks, to better connect communities. Elevated stations necessarily require pedestrian access bridges, providing further options to connect communities across highways and rivers. And while the trains run overhead, the space underneath is kept open for leisure and wildlife, which is an important concern in the park areas around Columbus' rivers.

The SAFEGE monorail design in particular is well-suited to Columbus' variable weather. The power supply lines are inside the beam, protected from the weather. Ice and snow can't accumulate inside the beam. Leaves and branches that fall atop the beam do not interfere with the train's passage, and the top of the beam can serve as a nesting area for birds.

Compared to vehicles that ride atop the tracks, there's a much-reduced risk of conflict between passengers and trains. The suspended train never comes into conflict with ground-dwelling pedestrians, bicyclists, drivers, or track-walkers. The elevation provides inherent grade separation. In combination with [platform screen doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_screen_doors), there's no opportunity for riders to come in conflict with the vehicle at stations. This can be compared to the Cinci streetcar, which is often blocked by cars, and freight trains in Columbus, which are often forced to slow or stop for obstacles on the track.

To help divert suburban commuter traffic from the roads, this line can be accompanied by the construction of several new park-and-ride locations:
