This route is based on the map in [the August 15, 2014 presentation before the Jobs, Expansion, and Transportation Task Force](https://web.archive.org/web/20150905224603/https://www.columbus.gov/uploadedFiles/Columbus/Departments/Development/JET%20Task%20Force%20-%20Transportation%20Presentation%20(August%2015%202014).pdf), which describes one main route and two optional alignments for a light-rail connection between the Airport and Downtown.

This route was only part of [the JET Task Force](https://web.archive.org/web/20220815123218/https://www.columbus.gov/planning/jettaskforce/)'s final report. The Task Force was charged with "developing recommendations on how best to strengthen our airport area as an economic hub and the center of transportation for the region"[^1], with recommendations covering many policy fields. Among their recommendations were more direct flights from Columbus to the West Coast and Europe, building a "multimodal transportation center" at the airport, investing in all modes of freight transport, bringing more industry to Columbus, and making lots of public-private partnerships. The Task Force compared the state of Columbus in 2014 to other major cities, and found Columbus lacking.

One of the ways that Columbus was lacking &mdash; and still is &mdash; is the absence of a rail connection between the Airport and Downtown. They wanted this rail system to be part of a larger network, and, unfortunately, they only designed the airport part of the network.

### Routes

{% include line-routes.html %}

This system includes a lot of street running, and I'm worried that future Columbus planners might choose to adopt this goal. As we've seen with Cincinnati's street car, running trains on the street means that your trains are blocked by every car accident and illegally-parked delivery driver, and your trains will never be faster than the private cars they're trying to replace.

### Stops

The JET Task Force didn't identify any specific stops in their report, but they did mention several destinations. I've taken the liberty of plotting those destinations on the map:

### Major Construction 

The report also identified several related construction projects which would be part of the light-rail project:
