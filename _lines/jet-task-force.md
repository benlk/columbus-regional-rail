This route is based on the map in [the August 15, 2014 presentation before the JET Task Force](https://web.archive.org/web/20150905224603/https://www.columbus.gov/uploadedFiles/Columbus/Departments/Development/JET%20Task%20Force%20-%20Transportation%20Presentation%20(August%2015%202014).pdf), which describes one main route and two optional alignments for a light-rail connection between the Airport and Downtown.

I'm concerned about the amount of street running that any of these alignments propose.

The JET Task Force didn't identify any specific stops in their report, but they did mention several destiantions. I've taken the liberty of plotting those destinations on the map:

The report also identified several related construction projects which would be part of the light-rail project:
