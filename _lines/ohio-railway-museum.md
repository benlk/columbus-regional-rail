The Ohio Railway Museum presently operates a trolley service from their museum in Worthington to a dead end in Colonial Hills, less than half a mile away. Their collection includes an operating electric trolley, one of the last remnants of Columbus' streetcar system.

What would happen if that line was extended? If a historical curiosity could be, through money and effort, be upgraded to a functional part of the city's urban fabric?

This page envisions an extension of the present-day Ohio Railway Museum line to the south along I-71, potentially all the way to the Convention Center, High Street, or the Scioto River.

### Key Considerations

The railroad right-of-way along I-71 contains several bridges and grade crossings. These would require revision in order to allow electrified tram tracks alongside non-electrified double-stack freight lines. A list of new bridges and grade crossing revisions is included below.

South of Fifth Avenue, several warehouses on the west side of the tracks have railroad access. Building tram access along this corridor will require interlockings that prevent conflicts between the tram and rail service. This is a significant obstacle, and may require surface-street routings for the streetcar.

The main proposed streetcar line in my map follows the freight rail lines underneath the highways, and into the underside of the Greater Columbus Convention Center. The construction of the new Hilton hotel tower left one track's worth of space between Convention Center Drive and the railroad tracks. This space may be claimed by pasenger train service as part of the 3C+D or Chicago-Columbus-Cleveland lines. A lack of track space underneath the Convention Center would require an alternative routing.

### Alternative Route

Shown on this map in dotted lines is an alternative route, running along surface streets to Downtown. This route avoids conflicts with warehouses and freight rail traffic, at the cost of street running. Lack of a dedicated right-of-way will inevitably result in service delays, especially is bad drivers park on the tram tracks.
