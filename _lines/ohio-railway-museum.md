The Ohio Railway Museum presently operates a very short trolley service. The museum's collection includes an operating electric trolley, one of the last remnants of Columbus' streetcar system. Their track runs from their museum in Worthington to a dead end in Colonial Hills, less than half a mile away. 

What would happen if that line were extended? If a historical curiosity could be, through money and effort, be upgraded to a functional part of the city's urban fabric?

This map envisions an extension of the present-day Ohio Railway Museum line to the south along I-71, potentially all the way to the Convention Center.

### Key Considerations

The first question is: where does the track run?

The current railroad right-of-way along I-71 contains two tracks for Norfolk Southern and two tracks for CSX, as can be seen in [the Ohio Rail Development Corporation rail map](https://ohiodot.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=82f597df8411453cafb18d62c371bc47).

The right-of-way itself is quite wide, with ample space for a fifth track. To avoid conflicts between the trolley service and the freight service, I propose bribing CSX with federal money.

The museum's track stops at about [the spot where the CSX and NS tracks cross](https://www.google.com/maps/place/The+Ohio+Railway+Museum/@40.0832668,-83.0008388,419m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x88388cadfbacaa11:0x8375ea7aed66670a!8m2!3d40.0931672!4d-83.0033828!16s%2Fm%2F027_zcx?hl=en), near Poste Lake. From that point, all the way south to 5th Avenue, there are no sidings on the west side of the tracks. If the passenger service runs on the west side of the freight tracks in this section, no freight traffic need cross or run on the passenger traffic rails. This is an extremely important consideration in route planning because the Federal Railroad Administration is loathe to allow passenger and freight service on the same tracks, even if the trains are separated by time and switches, especially if the passenger service uses lightweight vehicles like 1940s-era wooden streetcars.

From Worthington to 5th Avenue, the trolley would run on the west-most existing track. The bribe to allow this would be in the form of a hefty helping of Amtrak money. In exchange for giving up the west-most track to the museum, the feds and state would build a new track, with supporting bridges, running in the gap between the CSX and NS tracks. This new track would be built to high-speed-rail standards to support Amtrak service on the Cleveland-Columbus segment. In exchange for giving up one old track, the freight rail company gets one new track built to modern standards, with bridges to support it.

South of 5th Avenue, warehouses complicate the situation. Maintaining freight access to the warehouses south of 5th may require expensive signal interlockings or restrictions on the frequency of trolley service past the warehouse. If this is an insurmountable barrier, then the trolley cannot run south to the Convention Center. 

Limiting the trolley's run length limits its usability for commuter service. A trolley from Worthington to the Ohio State Fairgrounds is, outside of events at the Fairgrounds, little more than a historical amusement. 

Tearing down the warehouse to build dense housing is an honorable project, especially if it's transit-oriented, with a station for people who ride the train into Downtown.

South of 2nd, there are no more sidings on the west side of the tracks until the tracks run under the Greater Columbus Convention Center.

There is enough space on the northwest side of the CSX tracks to allow a new track to be laid without impacting Convention Center Drive. A station platform on Convention Center Drive, connecting to the Convention Center, would connect Worthington with Downtown, but would also connect Downtown's hotels with the State Fairgrounds. This car-free connection has the possibility of driving significant revenue to the Convention Center hotels, as well as removing many commuter cars from the road each day.

### Alternative Route

Shown on this map in dotted lines is an alternative route, running along surface streets to Downtown. This route avoids the warehouse entanglements at 5th Avenue, in exchange for street running.

This route avoids conflicts with warehouses and freight rail traffic, at the cost of street running. Lack of a dedicated right-of-way will inevitably result in service delays, especially if bad drivers park on the trolley tracks.

The proposed alternate path results in street running along Eleventh Avenue, with a transit stop at the Fairgrounds.

The trolley would run in dedicated curb-protected tracks on High Street and on 4th Street in a one-way loop, providing protection to bike lanes along the route. On Broad Street, the trolley would make use of the LinkUS BRT stations and lanes, and would of course include a stop at the Statehouse.

However, this alternative should only be considered if the 5th Avenue warehouse obstacle is insurmountable. Street running results in lower quality of service, is more expensive to build, and exposes the passengers to delays from bad drivers.
