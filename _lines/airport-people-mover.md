Columbus is an award-winning convention city, but it still has no regular public transportation between the airport and Downtown. That fact is a significant part of why Columbus keeps losing contracts to host national political conventions: no one wants to send party delegates to a city where they have to take an Uber to the convention hotel because [the last public bus leaves the airport at 8:29 p.m.](https://www.cota.com/timetables/7.pdf)

Los Angeles [just installed a 2.25-mile automated people mover](https://web.archive.org/web/20220328204906/https://thepointsguy.com/news/new-lax-people-movers-on-track-for-2023-completion/) to connect the LAX airport to parking, transit, and hotels.

Automated People Movers are, generally speaking, small trains running on dedicated concrete guideways. They run without drivers in fully automated systems, with platform screen doors. [They're all over the place in US airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airport_people_mover_systems), including [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_Transit_System), [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAX_Automated_People_Mover), [Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHX_Sky_Train), [Tampa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_International_Airport_People_Movers), [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTrain_(San_Francisco_International_Airport)), [Atlanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATL_SkyTrain), [JFK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirTrain_JFK), and .... you get the point. This technology is proven in airport contexts.

The same vehicles are used to provide transit services [in Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metromover), [Detroit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_People_Mover), [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurikamome), [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippori-Toneri_Liner), [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenhu_line), ... and many, many more locations. Automated trains are proven tech, with off-the-shelf solutions available from several manufacturers: [Alstom Inovia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alstom_Innovia), [Mitsubishi Crystal Mover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Mover), 

Columbus follow Los Angeles' example. Columbus' airport peoplemover should extend to the nearest local hotspot: Downtown Columbus. Such a system isn't just for airline passengers and convention-goers: stops along 670 would serve employers, schools, and neighborhoods east of Downtown.

By using automated people movers, Columbus would gain affordable, high-frequency, 24/7 service with self-driving vehicles on a dedicated track. LAX has a train every two minutes during peak hours, and automated people movers are used in several international metro systems.

Why this tech, and why now?

In 2022, the Columbus Regional Airport Authority [began designing a new terminal building](https://flycolumbus.com/at-port-columbus/terminal-modernization-program) for John Glenn International Airport. This redesign presents a perfect opportunity to build an automated people mover connecting the airport to Downtown. Our peer cities have equivalent transit connections. It's time for Columbus to catch up.

### Ridership

The most important consideration in any transit line is ridership: how many people can be expected to use it?

More than 30 million passengers boarded airplanes at John Glenn International Airport in 2021, according to the [2021 CRAA Annual Comprehensive Financial Report](https://columbusairports.com/storage/production/20220601113659-craa-2021-annual-comprehensive-financial-report.pdf). 

I haven't found numbers for the total number of guests at the Greater Columbus Convention Center in a year, or for the estimated number of passengers who fly into CMH and then go to a convention, but consider: The 2023 Arnold Sports Festival brought an estimated [100,000 people to Columbus for one event](https://www.10tv.com/article/entertainment/events/arnold-sports-festival-columbus-ohio/530-925690e5-1def-4379-956c-beecfafbe69b), including more than 12,000 athletes from around the world.

### Funding

Primary funds would come from the Columbus Regional Airport Authority and the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority, with additional money from the city, state, and feds as necessary. It would be ideal if CRAA and FCCFA could finance this project entirely from their own funds, and develop it under their own recognizance. COTA and MORPC are currently focused on [building bus rapid transit lines that don't approach the airport](https://linkuscolumbus.com/corridors/). 

Can CRAA and FCCFA afford this project?

- CRAA's [January 2023 board meeting notes](https://columbusairports.com/about-us/leadership-team/craa-board-of-directors/craa-board-meetings-and-minutes) report $135.7M in revenue in CY 2022, of which 33% was parking fees. Switching from the existing shuttle-bus solution to an APM wouldn't divert revenue. However, allowing passengers to ride the APM from Downtown or other transit routes to the airport, instead of requiring passengers to drive and park, would divert some revenue. This could be made up for by allowing suburban commuters to use CRAA parking lots for park-and-ride service into Downtown Columbus, or to other spots along the APM line. This includes the possibility of using the airport surface lots as a park-and-ride collector for the Amtrak station located at the Convention Center.
- FCCFA's [2023 budget documents](https://www.meetusincolumbus.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/2023-CFA-Full-Budget-Document.pdf) show that FCCFA financed the $269m cost of the new hospital tower by issuing $160m in bonds repayable over 30 years, backed by Franklin County's taxation authority. FCCFA charges a 4% hotel occupancy tax on Franklin County and an additional 0.9% occupancy tax within the City of Columbus; these taxes are projected to bring in $26.8 million dollars in 2023.

Operating costs would come from airport fees, increased rates on connecting hotels, and fares charged for people boarding the train at locations other than the airport.

Additionally, this system should pursue fare integration with COTA, to allow painless transfers from COTA bus lines.

The total construction cost of similar systems:

- [AirTrain JFK], NYC, 8.1 miles, 9 stations, three routes, 20k daily ridership, about $2 billion
- [LAX Automated People Mover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAX_Automated_People_Mover), California, 2.25 miles, 6 stations, 1 route, part of a $5.5 billion terminal modernization program
- Cairo, Egypt, paid Alstom [$2.7 billion for two automated monorail lines](https://www.alstom.com/monorail-story-greater-cairo) covering about 60 miles of track, with 30 years of operation and maintenance services included.
- [Las Vegas Monorail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Monorail), Nevada, 3.9 miles, 7 stations, 1 route, $650 million in 1995

- George Bush Intercontinental Airport [paid Alstom about $90 million for a 10-year maintenance contract](https://www.alstom.com/press-releases-news/2021/4/alstom-operate-and-maintain-innovia-people-mover-system-houstons-george-bush-intercontinental-airport) in 2021.
- Washington Dulles International Airport [paid Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Crystal Mover Services $136 million for a 10-year contract](https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Washington+Dulles+International+Airport+renews+contract+with+Crystal...-a0392166934) in 2014.
